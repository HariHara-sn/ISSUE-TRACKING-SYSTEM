**“Escalation”** means moving a problem to a higher level of authority when it cannot be solved at the current level.

**“Resolution tracking”** means keeping track of how a issue is being solved until it’s fully fixed.

- When someone reports an issue, the system records it.

- You track the progress: assigned → in progress → fixed → closed.

- You can see who is handling it, what actions were taken, and when it was resolved.
